What is Phishing and Why is it Important to Be Aware?
HTML;
$phishContentP1 = <<<HTML
Phishing is when cyber criminals pretend to be people or organizations you trust, like your bank or the government, to fool you into giving away personal information. They want things like your passwords, credit card numbers, or even who you are. It's like someone pretending to be your friend to get things from you that they shouldn't have.

How Does it Work?
HTML;
$phishContentP2 = <<<HTML
Picture getting an email or a message on your phone that seems to be from your bank. It might say something urgent like 'Your account is in trouble, click here to fix it.' But when you click that link or reply to the message, you're not talking to your bank. You're talking to a bad person who wants to steal from you. These bad people want your information to take your money or pretend to be you online. We'll explain more about this in our breakdown of different types of phishing.
